Genellipsis addresses the need to regularly type ellipses. It defines the
command \lip which can be used to produce series as `1, 2, ..., n` with
`\lip{1, 2; n}`. Each comma is followed by \allowbreak by default, and it is
possible to apply a command on the values, for example `\lip |A_\v| {1, 2; n}`
produces `A_1, A_2, ..., A_n`.

Other features include customization of separators and ellipsis, starting and
ending ellipses, and removing the allowbreak after commas.
